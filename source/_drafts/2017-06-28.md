so  I still need to find a job or living place. 

Here is not a good choice. I don’t want a working visa unless it can give me green card. 

There are Chinese who buy a big house to be motel for backpackers. loan a close friend who also Chinese here to manage. The friend can’t speak English. She is looking for a stuff, who is Chinese with good English, work here for a long time, and help she or he a working visa.

However it need 10 hours to be in the house, just give a room and food. If there are a lot local person here, maybe it’s useful for me. But if there is nobody i can talk to, it’s meaningless.

I need to see more different persons, different views, how can I get this?

Maybe i can talk to the manager, to ask that girl here to work, and just give me a bed in six room to sleep. i can also to help her in the hostel, cleaning and receipting. But i need time to learn the car and know more of the city. 

Money, time and fun, can be exchange.  
i need money to sleep, traffic and food. But i just have 52 weeks. 

Ms. Wang is very nice, but she doesn’t understand why I am here, I think i have choice, and i have told her that i will leave.
