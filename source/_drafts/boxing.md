Hi Jim, 
I have my first boxing course this noon, in gym nearby. It’s fantastic.  I like boxing, it makes me brave and healthy. I had boxing courses once or twice a week in Guangzhou for three months. But there is no girl boxing with me, is not quite fun. It’s also expensive in China, it would cost 300 Yuan(60 NZ dollar) per hour. 

In NZ, it’s quite cheap, just need  20 Yuan(4 NZ dollar) per hour. Coaches are more professional, fellows are more passion. I will go there every Monday to Friday.  

We jump rolls, quick run, core exercises, then train boxing skills. I met a girl there, she has boxing for a year, she has perfect figure, powerful
