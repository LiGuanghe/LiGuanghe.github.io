Last Saturday I’m a part of Cadbury Jaffa Race & World’s Steepest Street Party. It’s a fun party, Cadbury factory fall down 25000 jaffas from the steepest Street of the world in Dunedin at the same time. Each Jaffa has a number sold to public. The first one arrived the terminal get prize. All money will give somebody who needs help.
 
This event is organized every year, but this year maybe the last year, since the manager decide to close this factory and moved it to Austria.

I’m very lucky to attend this party.  When I first arrived in Dunedin, I was been told there will be a party like that, but I had to work in that day they planed. But that day had a bed weather they have to canceled and change another day. before the day I have a good work then I can go there. 

There was a girl named Jag, took me to take free bus to there, we eta many jaffas that day for lunch.
