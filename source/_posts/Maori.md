Since I can’t get feelings talking by myself when makes recorded program, I try to record what I talked with friend Lucas . It’s a surprise that he is Maori, and he told me a lot about that. 

Here is the beginning, I found his phone is from China, the brand is Huawei, his pronunciation of that is different, and he told me that’s because he is Maori. 

## Story of Name
His family name is a Maori kings name: Kīngitanga. However, there should not be king of Maori, because Maori first arrived in New Zealand by six ships, five have arrived at North Island, and the other arrived at South Island. They often fight for foods and filed. They have leaders each, not a king leads them whole.  After England people came here and show that there should be one king, Then they have a king. When he became king, he is very young, 16 or 17.
Lucas has this family name, means his grand grand grand ….. grandfather is the king.

I want to have a Maori name, he said Maori doesn’t do that, if you are not Maori, you cannot have Maori name. Sad. 

## Maori and Kiwi
Maori doesn’t equal to Kiwi. When someone is Maori, he must be kiwi, but a kiwi is not must be Maori. Kiwi means local of New Zealand. Maori is Indigenous peoples, like Aboriginal Australians.

Kiwi is not just means people, it also means a kind of bird, a kind of fruit. I eat kiwi every day , it’s cheap here and full of Vitamin C.

## Haka
The Haka is a traditional ancestral war cry, dance, or challenge from the Māori people of New Zealand. It is a posture dance performed by a group, with vigorous movements and stamping of the feet with rhythmically shouted accompaniment.

Lucas father teaches haka in high school, he also know how to dance. If you want to learn it in Dunedin, you can john Haka club in University of Otago. he said it’s simple to learn. 

## Maori language
Sounds simple, a e i o u, the pronunciation is a similar with Pinyin. So it’s easy to learn. In recorded program above, you can learn a simple song of Maori Language. 

In school, there is lesson you can choose to learn. Lucas loves culture of Maori, and is proud of being a Maori.

I told him I can speak Cantonese, different language often shows different culture. He agree with that.

之前用英语单独录博客总是没什么感觉, 这次试着把我和朋友的对话录下来播放, 这才是我的英语应该有的样子嘛. 这次聊天有惊喜, 朋友 Lucas 是一个毛利人, 他跟我分享了毛利人的文化和历史.

故事起源于他的手机, 我发现那是华为手机, 是的, 从中国来的华为手机. huawa 这个词他有不同的发音, 他说这是因为他是毛利人, 他们的发音会略有不同. 在这之后就聊开了. 

## 名字的故事
Lucas 给我看他的驾驶证, 他的姓是毛利名字. 他说这是毛利国王的名字. 当然毛利人是没有国王的, 以前他们分成不同的部落, 各自有族长. 互相还经常因为抢夺食物和土地争斗. 他们是乘着六艘船来到新西兰, 其中五艘抵达北岛, 一艘抵达南岛. 这样就形成了部落. 后来, 英国人来到新西兰, 给毛利人带来要有一个国王的观念, 所以就有了一个国王, 他成为国王时非常年轻, 才16.7 岁. 这是 Lucas 的祖先.

我告诉 Lucas 我母亲是满族, 祖先也是贵族. 只是在我的姓里面已经看不出来了.

## 毛利人和 kiwi
Kiwi 是新西兰本地人自称的一种称呼, 包括了毛利人, 但一个 Kiwi 不一定是毛利人. Kiwi 也不仅仅是人的自称, 还是新西兰特有的一种鸟和一种水果, 也就是奇异果或叫做猕猴桃, 我每天吃一个, 在这里吃真是又便宜又营养. 

## 毛利战舞
Lucas 的父亲在高中教毛利战舞, 这个舞蹈的特点是伸长舌头, 模仿头颅被悬挂起来的样子. 充满力量和激情的舞蹈. 在新西兰的大学, 都有战舞俱乐部, 想学的话就可以去, 据他说这个舞蹈是很简单的. 当然, 他毕业以后就没怎么跳了. 

## 毛利语
毛利语的元音发音跟英语不同, 但与汉语拼音相似, 我觉得并不难学. 在新西兰的学校也有毛利语课, 你可以选择学, 也可以不学. Lucas 学了, 他很为自己是毛利人自豪. 在录音里, 你可以听到他教了我一首毛利数字歌, 有兴趣的话, 你也可以学学看. 

我也很喜欢学习不同的语言, 那是不同的文化. 比如我喜欢粤语, 对于可以听懂粤语还能说一点点, 也是自豪着呢. 在这里, 我算是三语人才啦(哈哈, 夸大).
