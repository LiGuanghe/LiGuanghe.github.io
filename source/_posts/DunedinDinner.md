Last blog I mentioned my English is not good enough to make friends. Today I got friends, so let’s go to take a record.

## Cook is a good way
Cook is a good way to get friends. In backpackers hostel, people shared a big kitchen, you can watch what they cook, learn a lot of it. Chatting while cooking and eating makes you relax, easy to talk. 

I cooked for five new friends since they have cooked for me. NZ has really nice birds, one of them is small with long and beautiful tails. This a detail we have talked about. 

## Tips
If others cook for you, you can afford wine or drinks, or desert. You can help cooking or wash dishes after dinner.

交朋友要怎么开始呢?
## 一起做饭和分享晚餐是很好的方法
跟旅馆的每个人打过招呼, 互相大致了解之后, 似乎没有什么话说了. 这时要怎么办呢? 做好吃的, 一起分享. 约好一起做饭, 做饭吃饭时的谈话很放松, 慢慢的聊写生活日常, 找到了共同点. 

## 注意事项
如果对方做饭, 你可以打下手或洗碗. 对方提供食材的话, 如果你准备些酒等饮料, 或者饭后甜点之类的, 是很礼貌的行为. 当然, 在饭后有酒的话, 可以继续聊的更久更深入.
