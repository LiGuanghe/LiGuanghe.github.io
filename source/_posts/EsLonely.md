有人喜欢是幸福的, 可惜不是所有的时间都适合爱情. 

娇弱的花儿不去结果子, 落地成泥太久. 
折了夹进书页, 还没干瘪已被遗忘. 

若只要陪伴, 伴侣是懒得找寻后的底线. 
若一同渡过太平洋, 花儿比不得果实厚重压得住船. 

将目光调高, 指尖触低.
汁液自断处渗出, 扯几匹缎子裹上.

顺侧腰摸下去, 唯一紧实的曲线. 
绿色纤维壮了, 沾进两个脂肪桶.  

没人喜欢是幸福的, 花盘上又结瓜子了. 

***
Alone

Be loved is happiness, 
but not all the time is good for love.

Flowers don't work hard to be fruit,
too long to become mud.

Even put into books, 
be forgetton before dry.

Wants to get accompany, 
partners are too easy to get.

Wants to pass ossian together, 
fruits are more useful than flowers.

Look up, touch down.
Handle the pain by stretching.

Holding pretty part, 
Make body strong.

Not be loved is happiness,
more seeds grow in sunflowers.
